                and partially on research. Japan travel and food tourism are two of my biggest passions and this blog is a 
                culmination of those two things.

                    Tonkotsu ramen, also known as Hakata style ramen, is a type of Japanese soup originating in Fukuoka. The broth is made by
                    boiling pork bones for hours and hours until the collagen breaks down and turns the soup thick and rich. It's topped with thin noodles,
                    fatty pork belly, green onions, kikurage mushrooms, and boiled eggs. Tonkotsu ramen is heavy, rich, and savoury, and is a staple comfort food in Japan, 
                    a single bowl probably consists of half of the average person's daily caloric intake, and costs only $10. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fukuoka is also home to <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4803.html">yatai,</a> or food carts, and is the hub of street food in Japan. Due to strict health rules and urban regulations, yatai are somewhat 
                    rare in cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. In Fukuoka, there are about 150 licensed yatai left, and they are one of the city's most famous
                    food traditions, and they give the city a lively street food atmosphere. They serve all sorts of delicious comfort foods such as yakitori, gyoza, tempura,
                    and of course, tonkotsu ramen.

                    Osaka is often overlooked compared to Tokyo and Kyoto, however, its food scene is just as impressive as Fukuoka and Tokyo. It's mostly known 
                    as being "Japan's Kitchen," and for its outgoing and humorous drinking culture. There are countless izakaya and standing bars, and that’s where Osaka's 
                    iconic cuisines come into play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing accompanies a beer better than battered and fried anything. Osaka's most famous dishes are takoyaki, which are 
                    battered and fried octopus balls, okonomiyaki, which are savoury pancakes, filled with whatever your heart desires, and kushikatsu, which translates to 
                    skewered cutlet. Kushikatsu is one of my favorite Japanese dishes because you can order them one at a time, and you can order any meat or vegetable you 
                    can think of, paired with draft beer.

                    Osaka is lively, fun, and full of flavor. History fans will enjoy Osaka Castle, where you can walk inside a restored Japanese castle which features 
                    an impressive museum and art gallery. For families, Universal Studios is a popular destination, featuring attractions from popular franchises such as Nintendo,
                    Harry Potter, and Jurassic Park.

                    or filling up on beer and fried food at <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4012.html">Shinsekai,</a> Osaka's grubby "New World" district, which is now

                    The greater Tokyo metropolitan area is home to more than thirty-seven million people and has grown into a true cultural melting pot. 
                    Its food scene is famously competitive, drawing chefs from every corner of Japan and from all over the world who want to showcase the dish they 
                    are best at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a single street you might find fresh nigiri with roots in nineteenth-century Tokyo, Korean barbecue, Italian pizza, and Turkish 
                    kebab all side by side. Tokyo also holds more Michelin starred restaurants than any other city, making it a proving ground where chefs push their 
                    technique, creativity, and dedication to the highest level.

                    When you're not too busy stuffing your face and enjoying the many flavors of Tokyo, there is seemingly infinite possibilities for an itinerary. 
                    Tokyo is rich in history, being home to the Imperial Palace, massive Shinto shrines, and National museums. 
                    One such museum, <a href="https://www.ukiyoe-ota-muse.jp/eng/">Ōta Memorial Museum of Art,</a> displays traditional Japanese paintings that have been preserved for 400 years,
                    and if that's too boring for you, there's probably a 10-story arcade or an underground shopping mall around the corner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also a sprawling nightlife, with entire districts being dedicated to skyscrapers full of bars and nightclubs that are open until 6 am. In places like Shinjuku and Shibuya
                    it's not uncommon to see salarymen who missed the last train <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/photos-of-japans-office-workers-during-their-60-hour-weeks/">passed out in the street,</a> often accompanied by a water bottle or a sports drink that a kind

                    Japan has many regional varieties of ramen, Sapporo's specialty is miso ramen, and more specifically, miso buttercorn ramen. While it's jarring
                    seeing a bowl of soup topped with a pile of corn and an entire stick of butter, it's rich, creamy, and delicious, even more so during the winter. 
                    It also features the thin noodles, chashu pork, seaweed, and bamboo shoots found in a regular bowl of ramen, and is somehow richer than the famously
                    fatty tonkotsu ramen. I was skeptical at first but after trying it I understood why this was such a staple comfort food in Sapporo. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another staple of Hokkaido is grilled mutton, dubbed Genghis Khan, after the founder of the Mongol Empire. It's cooked on a metal grill on the center
                    of the dining table, usually accompanied by assorted vegetables. It can be enjoyed across Hokkaido, but one of the most popular places to enjoy it is
                    at the beer hall at the Sapporo beer museum. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of the <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5300.html">Sapporo beer museum,</a> Sapporo beer is one of the oldest beer brands in the country, having been brewed since 1877. The Sapporo beer museum
                    was built in 1987 in a former brewery, introducing the history of beer in Japan and the process of beer brewing. It includes a beer hall where you can
                    enjoy all you can drink beer and all you can eat mutton, Genghis Khan.

                    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ToNkv2fohfersV2BA">Ganso Ramen Yokocho</a> is an alley in Sapporo dedicated entirely to ramen shops, home to 17 unique
                    ramen shops, offering their own takes on different regional ramen dishes. The overarching theme however is of course Sapporo style miso ramen. If you're lucky,
                    and there's no queue, you can even visit <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hnt6sDHzg6iayUhd9">Aji No Karyu</a>, a famous miso buttercorn ramen shop that Anthony Bourdain
                    visited during his No Reservations series.

                    Sapporo is in the Hokkaido prefecture, which is the northernmost island of Japan. The region is cold and mountainous,
                    known for its ski resorts, great beer, and of course its food. The city itself is home to the Sapporo beer museum, a 
                    ramen alley filled with shops that represent styles from all over Japan, and a huge central park that hosts winter and beer 
                    festivals depending on the season.

                <p>
                    Okinawa's cuisine is influenced by its history as a trade hub for China, Japan, and America, due to its post World War 2 occupation. China in particular
                    has very deep roots in Okinawa, introducing the Ryukyu natives to wheat noodles and pork in the late 14th century. Okinawa <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2341.html">Soba</a> is the region's most 
                    well-known dish, and historically was even referred to as Chinese Soba. It consists of thick, flat wheat noodles, a light pork broth, green onion, red pickled 
                    ginger, and of course, pork belly. While it's not as rich or extravagant as a typical bowl of ramen, it's equally satisfying, and in Okinawa's warm climate,
                    it's almost refreshing, especially when served with a cold beer.

                    Okinawa, known as the Ryukyu Islands to the native inhabitants, is an interesting case because it was under occupation by the United States 
                    government after World War 2 and was formally controlled by the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands until 1972. As such, there
                    is a large concentration of USA military bases, and a large American influence on culture and infrastructure. If, for some reason you visited Japan, and wanted
                    to experience America's rich culture, you can visit The Mihama American Village in Okinawa, and try 
                    <a href="https://en.japantravel.com/okinawa/a-w-restaurants/8408">Japanese A&W,</a> which only exists in Okinawa.

                <p>
                    Okinawa is far south from mainland Japan and as such, experiences a warm climate year-round. It is also known for its sandy beaches and clear blue water,
                    making it a popular destination for surfing, snorkeling, and other water sports. There are about 
                    <a href="https://visitokinawajapan.com/destinations/">160 islands</a> in the Okinawa archipelago, of which around 40
                    are actually inhabited. Smaller islands surrounding the main Okinawa Island are known for their national parks, resorts, whale watching, and beautiful beaches.
